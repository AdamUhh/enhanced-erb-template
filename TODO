Todo:
  ☐ Perhaps add setLocalAndStateReducer, it seems useful?
  


Some ideas:
  ☐ Create a file that calls ipc, waits for return, and then calls redux?
    ☐ This way, we can also handle errors?
  ☐ Shortcuts 


Need to be able to:
  ☐ Toggle Click
    ☐ with return
    ☐ with notification
  ☐ Shortcut toggle 
    ☐ with return
  
Things to do:
  ☐ Change to frameless titlebar and create custom one
    ☐ Custom titlebar should have:
      ☐ close, minimize, maximize
      ☐ logo on left
      ☐ custom menubars on left (menuregistry)
        ☐ these menubars are defined & built by client side (not electron side accelerators)
          ☐ this means shortcuts run on client side as well
          ☐ Remember, not all shortcuts will be on the menubar, so they will be separate
            ☐ perhaps combine menubar and keybindings data?

            ☐ menubar is for appearances, and needs metadata:
              ☐ command {
                ☐ id
                ☐ title (in future, perhaps localize it? (i18n)) }
              ☐ order (ranking order to display)
              ☐ category (which menu dropdown to display it on)
              ☐ subcategory (optional)
              ☐ isToggled?
              ☐ when (think of it like a 'exist' fn, ex: menu item is only shown when editor is focused)
                ☐ (continuation of when: ex 2: save all menu item will be disabled if there is nothing to be saved)

            ☐ keybindings registry (shortcuts) will have 
              ☐ id
              ☐ keybindings
              ☐ secondaryKeybindings
              ☐ when

          ☐ when a shortcut is clicked/keypressed
            ☐ client will attempt to execute the id (in vscode src, find commandService.ts)
            
  ☐ state managed by client, with ipc requests to electron store to save data
  ☐ example should showcase:
    ☐ toggle
    ☐ toggle with notification
    ☐ toggle with shortcut
    ☐ toggle with shortcut & notification
    ☐ success example
    ☐ fail example
