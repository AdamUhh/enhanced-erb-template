Some ideas:
  ☐ Shortcuts 


Need to be able to:
  ✔ Toggle Click @done(24-01-27 22:48)
    ✔ with return @done(24-01-27 22:48)
    ✔ with notification @done(24-01-27 22:48)
  ☐ Shortcut toggle 
    ☐ with return
  
Things to do:
  ✔ Change to frameless titlebar and create custom one @done(24-01-27 22:48)
    ✔ Custom titlebar should have: @done(24-01-27 22:48)
      ✔ close, minimize, maximize @done(24-01-27 22:48)
      ✔ logo on left @done(24-01-27 22:48)
      ☐ custom menubars on left (menuregistry)
        ☐ these menubars are defined & built by client side (not electron side accelerators)
          ☐ this means shortcuts run on client side as well
          ☐ Remember, not all shortcuts will be on the menubar, so they will be separate
            ☐ perhaps combine menubar and keybindings data?

            ☐ menubar is for appearances, and needs metadata:
              ☐ command {
                ☐ id
                ☐ title (in future, perhaps localize it? (i18n)) }
              ☐ order (ranking order to display)
              ☐ category (which menu dropdown to display it on)
              ☐ subcategory (optional)
              ☐ isToggled?
              ☐ when (think of it like a 'exist' fn, ex: menu item is only shown when editor is focused)
                ☐ (continuation of when: ex 2: save all menu item will be disabled if there is nothing to be saved)

            ☐ keybindings registry (shortcuts) will have 
              ☐ id
              ☐ keybindings
              ☐ secondaryKeybindings
              ☐ when

          ☐ when a shortcut is clicked/keypressed
            ☐ client will attempt to execute the id (in vscode src, find commandService.ts)
            
  ☐ state managed by client, with ipc requests to electron store to save data
  ✔ example should showcase: @done(24-01-27 22:49)
    ✔ toggle @done(24-01-27 22:49)
    ✔ toggle with notification @done(24-01-27 22:49)
    ✔ toggle with shortcut @done(24-01-27 22:49)
    ✔ toggle with shortcut & notification @done(24-01-27 22:49)
    ✔ success example @done(24-01-27 22:49)
    ✔ fail example @done(24-01-27 22:49)
